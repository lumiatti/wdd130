    <h2>Cézar Lumiatti Teixeira</h2>
    <p>I’m from Brazil. I live in the southernmost state here, Rio Grande do Sul.

    I have been married for thirteen years, and we have two little boys.</p>
    
    <p>I love to play and watch football (soccer). I love to read and learn about history. Currently, I’m reading a lot about the history of my country. I’m very curious and fascinated by astronomy too.</p>
    
    <p>I have a degree in industrial automation, and now I decided to start a new challenge in my life: a second degree.
    
    I’m working for a company that develops software for industrial automation, more specifically the real-time SCADA platform. I’m not a developer; I’m an instructor, and my job is to teach our customers how to use this software.</p>
